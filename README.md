# CI-30Xa
Inspired by the TI-30Xa, this calculator implements elementary math functions within C without the use of its default libraries. 
Still needs work in exception handling and UI.

The CI-30Xa calculates these elementary functions using Taylor series and algebraic methods. The algebra involved with this
is normally used to decrease the magnitude of the argument and/or change its sign so that calculating the taylor series becomes
much less cumbersome on the computer.

For now, you can only input numbers rather than mathematical constants like pi and e, since I haven't implemented strings.

The calculator also doesn't compile with the gcc command in terminal. Use g++ instead.
